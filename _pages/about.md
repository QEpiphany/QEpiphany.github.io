I'm a first-year PhD student from [School of EECS](https://eecs.uq.edu.au/), [The University of Queensland (UQ)](https://www.uq.edu.au/), supervised by [Prof. Hongzhi Yin](https://sites.google.com/view/hongzhi-yin/home) and and [A/Prof. Tong Chen](https://about.uq.edu.au/experts/27868). Previously, from July to September 2024, I did a research internship at Tsinghua University, working under the guidance of [Dr. Chen Gao](https://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~gaochen/). In June 2024, I completed my master's degree at Chongqing University, under the supervision of [Prof. Junhao Wen](https://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/info/2095/3491.htm).

My research interests mainly include: 
* Sequential Recommendation
* Session-based Recommendation
* LLM-based Recommendation.
